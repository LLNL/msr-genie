		33		IN_TXCP: See Section 20.3.6.5.1. When IN_TXCP=1 & IN_TX=1 and in sampling, a spurious PMI may occur and transactions may continuously abort near overflow conditions. Software should favor using IN_TXCP for counting over sampling. If sampling, software should use large “sample-after” value after clearing the counter configured to use IN_TXCP and also always reset the counter even when no overflow condition was reported.

60BH	1548	MSR_PKGC_IRTL1	Package	Package C6/C7 Interrupt Response Limit 1 (R/W) This MSR defines the interrupt response time limit used by the processor to manage a transition to a package C6 or C7 state. The latency programmed in this register is for the shorter-latency sub C-states used by an MWAIT hint to a C6 or C7 state. Note: C-state values are processor specific C-state code names, unrelated to MWAIT extension C-state parameters or ACPI C-States.
