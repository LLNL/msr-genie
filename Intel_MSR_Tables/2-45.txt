A7H	167	MSR_BIOS_DEBUG	Thread	BIOS DEBUG (R/O) This MSR indicates if WRMSR 79H failed to configure PRM memory and gives a hint to debug BIOS.
		30:0		Reserved
		31		MCU Partial Success When set to 1, WRMSR 79H skipped part of the functionality during BIOS.

CFH	207	IA32_CORE_CAPABILITIES	Package	IA32 Core Capabilities Register (R/O) If CPUID.(EAX=07H, ECX=0):EDX[30] = 1. This MSR provides an architectural enumeration function for model-specific behavior.
		1:0		Reserved
		2		FUSA_SUPPORTED
		3		RSM_IN_CPL0_ONLY When set to 1, the RSM instruction is only allowed in CPL0 (#GP triggered in any CPL != 0). When set to 0, then any CPL may execute the RSM instruction.
		4		Reserved
		5		SPLIT_LOCK_DISABLE_SUPPORTED When read as 1, software can set bit 29 of MSR_MEMORY_CTRL (MSR address 33H).

492H	1170	IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS3	Core	IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS3 This MSR enumerates the allowed 1-settings of the third set of processor-based controls. Specifically, VM entry allows bit X of the tertiary processor-based VM- execution controls to be 1 if and only if bit X of the MSR is set to 1. If bit X of the MSR is cleared to 0, VM entry fails if control X and the “activate tertiary controls” primary processor-based VM-execution control are both 1.
		0		LOADIWKEY This control determines whether executions of LOADIWKEY cause VM exits.

601H	1537	MSR_VR_CURRENT_CONFIG	Package	Power Limit 4 (PL4) Package-level maximum power limit (in Watts). It is a proactive, instantaneous limit.
		12:0		PL4 Value PL4 value in 0.125 A increments. This field is locked by VR_CURRENT_CONFIG[LOCK]. When the LOCK bit is set to 1b, this field becomes Read Only.
		30:13		Reserved
		31		Lock Indication (LOCK) This bit will lock the CURRENT_LIMIT settings in this register and will also lock this setting. This means that once set to 1b, the CURRENT_LIMIT setting and this bit become Read Only until the next Warm Reset.
		62:32		Not in use.

C82H	3202	IA32_L2_QOS_CFG	Core	IA32_CR_L2_QOS_CFG This MSR provides software an enumeration of the parameters that L2 QoS (Intel RDT) support in any particular implementation.
		0		CDP_ENABLE When set to 1, it will enable the code and data prioritization for the L2 CAT/Intel RDT feature. When set to 0, code and data prioritization is disabled for L2 CAT/Intel RDT. See Chapter 18, “Debug, Branch Profile, TSC, and Intel® Resource Director Technology (Intel® RDT) Features‚” for further details on CDP.

D10H-D17H	3220 - 3351	IA32_L2_QOS_MASK_[0-7]	Package	IA32_CR_L2_QOS_MASK_[0-7] Controls MLC (L2) Intel RDT allocation. For more details on CAT/RDT, see Chapter 18, “Debug, Branch Profile, TSC, and Intel® Resource Director Technology (Intel® RDT) Features.”
		19:0		WAYS_MASK Setting a 1 in this bit X allows threads with CLOS <n> (where N is [0-7]) to allocate to way X in the MLC. Ones are only allowed to be written to ways that physically exist in the MLC (CPUID.4.2:EBX[31:22] will indicate this). Writing a 1 to a value beyond the highest way or a non-contiguous set of 1s will cause a #GP on the WRMSR to this MSR.
