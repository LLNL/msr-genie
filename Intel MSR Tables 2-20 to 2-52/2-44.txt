329H	809	MSR_PERF_METRICS	Thread	Performance Metrics (R/W) Reports metrics directly. Software can check (and/or expose to its guests) the availability of PERF_METRICS feature using IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES.PERF_METRICS_AVAILABL E (bit 15).

3F2H	1010	MSR_PEBS_DATA_CFG	Thread	PEBS Data Configuration (R/W) Provides software the capability to select data groups of interest and thus reduce the record size in memory and record generation latency. Hence, a PEBS record's size and layout vary based on the selected groups. The MSR also allows software to select LBR depth for branch data records.
		0		Memory Info. Setting this bit will capture memory information such as the linear address, data source and latency of the memory access in the PEBS record.
		1		GPRs. Setting this bit will capture the contents of the General Purpose registers in the PEBS record.
		2		XMMs. Setting this bit will capture the contents of the XMM registers in the PEBS record.
		3		LBRs. Setting this bit will capture LBR TO, FROM, and INFO in the PEBS record.
		23:4		Reserved.
		31:24		LBR Entries. Set the field to the desired number of entries - 1. For example, if the LBR_entries field is 0, a single entry will be included in the record. To include 32 LBR entries, set the LBR_entries field to 31 (0x1F). To ensure all PEBS records are 16-byte aligned, software can use LBR_entries that is multiple of 3.

657H	1623	MSR_FAST_UNCORE_MSRS_CTL	Thread	Fast WRMSR/RDMSR Control MSR (R/W)
		3:0		FAST_ACCESS_ENABLE: Bit 0: When set to '1', provides a hint for the hardware to enable fast access mode for the IA32_HWP_REQUEST MSR. This bit is sticky and is cleaned by the hardware only during reset time. This bit is valid only if FAST_UNCORE_MSRS_CAPABILITY[0] is set. Setting this bit will cause CPUID[6].EAX[18] to be set.

65EH	1630	MSR_FAST_UNCORE_MSRS_STATUS	Thread	Indication of Uncore MSRs, Post Write Activates
		0		Indicates whether the CPU is still in the middle of writing IA32_HWP_REQUEST MSR, even after the WRMSR instruction has retired. A value of 1 indicates the last write of IA32_HWP_REQUEST is still ongoing. A value of 0 indicates the last write of IA32_HWP_REQUEST is visible outside the logical processor. Software can use the status of this bit to avoid overwriting IA32_HWP_REQUEST.
