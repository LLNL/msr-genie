		3:0		Package C-State Limit (R/W) Specifies the lowest processor-specific C-state code name (consuming the least power) for the package. The default is set as factory-configured package C-state limit. The following C-state code name encodings are supported: 0000b: C0/C1 (no package C-state support) 0001b: C2 0010b: C3 0011b: C6 0100b: C7 0101b: C7s 0110b: C8 0111b: C9 1000b: C10
