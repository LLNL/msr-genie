		1		Thermal Status (R0) When set, frequency is reduced due to a thermal event.
		4:2		Reserved
		5		Running Average Thermal Limit Status (R0) When set, frequency is reduced due to running average thermal limit.
		6		VR Therm Alert Status (R0) When set, frequency is reduced due to a thermal alert from a processor Voltage Regulator.
		7		VR Thermal Design Current Status (R0) When set, frequency is reduced due to VR TDC limit.
		8		Other Status (R0) When set, frequency is reduced due to electrical or other constraints.
		9		Reserved
		10		Package/Platform-Level Power Limiting PL1 Status (R0) When set, frequency is reduced due to package/Platform-level power limiting PL1.
		11		Package/Platform-Level PL2 Power Limiting Status (R0) When set, frequency is reduced due to package/Platform-level power limiting PL2/PL3.
		15:12		Reserved
		16		PROCHOT Log When set, indicates that the PROCHOT Status bit has asserted since the log bit was last cleared. This log bit will remain set until cleared by software writing 0.
		17		Thermal Log When set, indicates that the Thermal Status bit has asserted since the log bit was last cleared. This log bit will remain set until cleared by software writing 0.
		20:18		Reserved
		21		Running Average Thermal Limit Log When set, indicates that the RATL Status bit has asserted since the log bit was last cleared. This log bit will remain set until cleared by software writing 0.
		22		VR Therm Alert Log When set, indicates that the VR Therm Alert Status bit has asserted since the log bit was last cleared. This log bit will remain set until cleared by software writing 0.
		23		VR Thermal Design Current Log When set, indicates that the VR Therm Alert Status bit has asserted since the log bit was last cleared. This log bit will remain set until cleared by software writing 0.
		24		Other Log When set, indicates that the OTHER Status bit has asserted since the log bit was last cleared. This log bit will remain set until cleared by software writing 0.
		25		Reserved
		26		Package/Platform-Level PL1 Power Limiting Log When set, indicates that the Package/Platform Level PL1 Power Limiting Status bit has asserted since the log bit was last cleared. This log bit will remain set until cleared by software writing 0.
		27		Package/Platform-Level PL2 Power Limiting Log When set, indicates that the Package/Platform Level PL2 Power Limiting Status bit has asserted since the log bit was last cleared. This log bit will remain set until cleared by software writing 0.
