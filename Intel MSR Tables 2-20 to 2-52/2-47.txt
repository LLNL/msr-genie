1A4H	420	MSR_PREFETCH_CONTROL		Prefetch Disable Bits (R/W)
		0		L2_HARDWARE_PREFETCHER_DISABLE If 1, disables the L2 hardware prefetcher, which fetches additional lines of code or data into the L2 cache.		
		1		L2_ADJACENT_CACHE_LINE_PREFETCHER_DISABLE If 1, disables the adjacent cache line prefetcher, which fetches the cache line that comprises a cache line pair (128 bytes).
		2		DCU_HARDWARE_PREFETCHER_DISABLE If 1, disables the L1 data cache prefetcher, which fetches the next cache line into L1 data cache.
		3		DCU_IP_PREFETCHER_DISABLE If 1, disables the L1 data cache IP prefetcher, which uses sequential load history (based on instruction pointer of previous loads) to determine whether to prefetch additional lines.
		4		Reserved.
		5		AMP_PREFETCH_DISABLE If 1, disables the L2 Adaptive Multipath Probability (AMP) prefetcher.
		63:6		Reserved.
3F7H	1015	MSR_PEBS_FRONTEND	Thread	FrontEnd Precise Event Condition Select (R/W) See Table 2-39.
540H	1344	MSR_THREAD_UARCH_CTL	Thread	Thread Microarchitectural Control (R/W)
		0		WB_MEM_STRM_LD_DISABLE Disable streaming behavior for MOVNTDQA loads to WB memory type. If set, these accesses will be treated like regular cacheable loads (Data will be cached).

541H	1345	MSR_CORE_UARCH_CTL	Core	Core Microarchitecture Control MSR (R/W) See Table 2-44.
D10H - D17H	3220 - 3351	IA32_L2_QOS_MASK_[0-7]	Core	IA32_CR_L2_QOS_MASK_[0-7] If CPUID.(EAX=10H, ECX=1):EDX.COS_MAX[15:0] ≥ 0. Controls MLC (L2) Intel RDT allocation. For more details on CAT/RDT, see Chapter 18, “Debug, Branch Profile, TSC, and Intel® Resource Director Technology (Intel® RDT) Features.”
		19:0		WAYS_MASK Setting a 1 in this bit X allows threads with CLOS <n> (where N is [0-7]) to allocate to way X in the MLC. Ones are only allowed to be written to ways that physically exist in the MLC (CPUID.4.2:EBX[31:22] will indicate this). Writing a 1 to a value beyond the highest way or a non-contiguous set of 1s will cause a #GP on the WRMSR to this MSR.
