2F4H	756	MSR_UNCORE_PRMRR_PHYS_BASE1	Package	(R/W) The PRMRR range is used to protect the processor reserved memory from unauthorized reads and writes. Any IO access to this range is aborted. This register controls the location of the PRMRR range by indicating its starting address. It functions in tandem with the PRMRR mask register.
		11:0		Reserved
		PAWIDTH-1:12		Range Base This field corresponds to bits PAWIDTH-1:12 of the base address memory range which is allocated to PRMRR memory.
		63:PAWIDTH		Reserved
2F5H	757	MSR_UNCORE_PRMRR_PHYS_MASK1	Package	(R/W) This register controls the size of the PRMRR range by indicating which address bits must match the PRMRR base register value.
		9:0		Reserved
		10		Lock Setting this bit locks all writeable settings in this register, including itself.
		11		Range_En Indicates whether the PRMRR range is enabled and valid.
		38:12		Range_Mask This field indicates which address bits must match PRMRR base in order to qualify as an PRMRR access.
		63:39		Reserved
620H	1568	MSR_RING_RATIO_LIMIT	Package	Ring Ratio Limit (R/W) This register provides Min/Max Ratio Limits for the LLC and Ring.
		6:0		MAX_Ratio This field is used to limit the max ratio of the LLC/Ring.
		7		Reserved
		14:8		MIN_Ratio Writing to this field controls the minimum possible ratio of the LLC/Ring.
