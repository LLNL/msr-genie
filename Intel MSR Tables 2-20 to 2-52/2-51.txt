612H	1554	MSR_PACKAGE_ENERGY_TIME_STATUS	Package	Package energy consumed by the entire CPU (R/W)
		31:0		Total amount of energy consumed since last reset.
		63:32		Total time elapsed when the energy was last updated. This is a monotonic increment counter with auto wrap back to zero after overflow. Unit is 10ns.
618H	1560	MSR_DRAM_POWER_LIMIT	Package	Allows software to set power limits for the DRAM domain and measurement attributes associated with each limit.
		14:0		DRAM_PP_PWR_LIM: Power Limit[0] for DDR domain. Units = Watts, Format = 11.3, Resolution = 0.125W, Range = 0-2047.875W.
		15		PWR_LIM_CTRL_EN: Power Limit[0] enable bit for DDR domain.
		16		Reserved
		23:17		CTRL_TIME_WIN: Power Limit[0] time window Y value, for DDR domain. Actual time_window for RAPL is: (1/1024 seconds) * (1+(x/4)) * (2^y)
		62:24		Reserved
		63		PP_PWR_LIM_LOCK: When set, this entire register becomes read-only. This bit will typically be set by BIOS during boot.
619H	1561	MSR_DRAM_ENERGY_STATUS	Package	DRAM Energy Status (R/O) See Section 15.10.5, “DRAM RAPL Domain.”
		31:0		Energy in 15.3 micro-joules. Requires BIOS configuration to enable DRAM RAPL mode 0 (Direct VR).
		63:32		Reserved
61BH	1563	MSR_DRAM_PERF_STATUS	Package	DRAM Performance Throttling Status (R/O) See Section 15.10.5, “DRAM RAPL Domain.”
61CH	1564	MSR_DRAM_POWER_INFO	Package	DRAM Power Parameters (R/W)
		14:0		Spec DRAM Power (DRAM_TDP): The Spec power allowed for DRAM. The TDP setting is typical (not guaranteed). The units for this value are defined in MSR_DRAM_POWER_INFO_UNIT[PWR_UNIT].
		15		Reserved
		30:16		Minimal DRAM Power (DRAM_MIN_PWR): The minimal power setting allowed for DRAM. Lower values will be clamped to this value. The minimum setting is typical (not guaranteed). The units for this value are defined in MSR_DRAM_POWER_INFO_UNIT[PWR_UNIT].
		31		Reserved
		46:32		Maximal Package Power (DRAM_MAX_PWR): The maximal power setting allowed for DRAM. Higher values will be clamped to this value. The maximum setting is typical (not guaranteed). The units for this value are defined in MSR_DRAM_POWER_INFO_UNIT[PWR_UNIT].
		47		Reserved
		54:48		Maximal Time Window (DRAM_MAX_WIN): The maximal time window allowed for the DRAM. Higher values will be clamped to this value. x = PKG_MAX_WIN[54:53] y = PKG_MAX_WIN[52:48] The timing interval window is a floating-point number given by 1.x *power(2,y). The unit of measurement is defined in MSR_DRAM_POWER_INFO_UNIT[TIME_UNIT].
		62:55		Reserved
		63		LOCK: Lock bit to lock the register.
