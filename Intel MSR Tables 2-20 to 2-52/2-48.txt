D10H - D1FH	3220 - 3359	IA32_L2_QOS_MASK_[0-15]	Module	IA32_CR_L2_QOS_MASK_[0-15] If CPUID.(EAX=10H, ECX=1):EDX.COS_MAX[15:0] ≥ 0. Controls MLC (L2) Intel RDT allocation. For more details on CAT/RDT, see Chapter 18, “Debug, Branch Profile, TSC, and Intel® Resource Director Technology (Intel® RDT) Features.”
		19:0		WAYS_MASK Setting a 1 in this bit X allows threads with CLOS <n> (where N is [0-7]) to allocate to way X in the MLC. Ones are only allowed to be written to ways that physically exist in the MLC (CPUID.4.2:EBX[31:22] will indicate this). Writing a 1 to a value beyond the highest way or a non-contiguous set of 1s will cause a #GP on the WRMSR to this MSR.
